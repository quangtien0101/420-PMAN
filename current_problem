Pacman will always has 2 goals list:
	one is for the food that it has seen
	one is for exploring the map to find food when the food list is empty

	pacman will always try to reach the nearest food
	if there is no food, it will try to go for the nearest goal possition for explortation
	

Running a map with static monster and 2 food
adding food possition and removing food possition is not working properly
	fixed!

Making the monster move randomly
	done but it's very dump

Test if there is a wall standing before the the food
	pacman is current stuck because it keep going back where it's comming from
	implement a previous move so that it won't go back where it just came from when it's possible
	

Test when pacman is spawn near some monsters (tested)

test level 1
test level 2

there is some problem with the old_possition

=======================================
MAP
	should not contains L or Ushape
