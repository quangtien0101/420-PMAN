Pacman will always has 2 goals list:
	one is for the food that it has seen
	one is for exploring the map to find food when the food list is empty

Running a map with static monster and 2 food
adding food possition and removing food possition is not working properly
	fixed!

Making the monster move randomly
	done but it's very dump

Test when pacman is spawn near some monsters (not tested yet)
